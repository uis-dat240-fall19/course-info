# Autograder

Autograder is a tool for students and teaching staff to manage the submition and
validating lab assignments. Autograder has been developed at the University of Stavanger.
All lab submissions from students are handled using Git, a source code
management system, and GitHub, a web-based hosting service for Git source
repositories.

Students push their updated lab submissions to GitHub. Every lab submission is
then processed by a custom continuous integration tool. This tool will run
several test cases on the submitted code. Autograder generates feedback that
let the students verify if their submission implements the required
functionality. This feedback is available through a web interface. The feedback
from the Autograder system can be used by students to improve their
submissions.

Below is a step-by-step explanation of how to register and sign up for the lab
